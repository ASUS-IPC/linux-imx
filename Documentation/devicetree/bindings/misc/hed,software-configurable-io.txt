* HED Software Configurable I/O driver.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "hed,software-configurable-io"
  - One of the following types of I/O property is required:
    - input-only: The I/O is input only
    - output-only: The I/O is output only
    - output-and-input: The I/O can do both output and input.  This is the case
        with an output that has an output diagnostics software configurable
        input.

Required properties for output functionality:
  - For GPIO output mode (default):
    - output-gpio: The GPIO that controls the output.
  - For PWM output mode:
    - pwms: The PWM that controls the output.
  - default-output-state: Can be either <0> for off or <1> for on;

Required properties for input functionality:
  - input-gpio: The GPIO that is the input that is measured. Optional if GPIO
      and ADC are not the same pin.
  - io-channels: The ADC IIO driver device reference and channel that the
      input is measured from.
  - io-channel-names: The ADC IIO channel name of the channels listed in
      io-channels in the same order.
  - selection-gpios: The GPIOs that are used to select the input mode.  The
      order of these GPIOs must match the order of the selection-gpio-names.
  - selection-gpio-names: The names of the GPIOs that are used to select the
      input mode.  The order of these names in string form must match the
      order of the selection-gpios.
  - selection-mapping-names: A string representation of an input mode.  The
      order of the strings must match the matching selection-mappings value.
  - selection-mappings: The selection-gpio values to configure the input mode.
      The order of the values must match the matching selection-mapping-names
      string.  The value must also be the value for all GPIOs listed in
      selection-gpios in the order they are listed.  If selection-gpios
      contains two GPIOs, <gpio1 1>, <gpio1 2> , then a value of <1> means the
      <gpio1 1> is set to 0 and <gpio1 2> is set to 1.  A value of <3> means
      both gpios would be set to 1.
  - default-input-mode: This is the default mode the input will be in at boot.
      This value should be one of the selection-mapping-names strings.


Optional properties:
  - output-pwm: By default an output is in GPIO mode unless this property is
      added.  With this property enable, the output is controlled as a PWM in
      PWM mode.
  - non-selectable-input: Makes pin mode static.

Examples:
- Input only:
software_configurable_input {
	compatible = "hed,software-configurable-io";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_softcfgin-a12>;
	input-only;
	input-gpio = <&gpio1 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	io-channels = <&adc 0>;
	io-channel-names = "input1";
	selection-gpio-names = "MPU_IN_SEL0", "MPU_IN_SEL1", "MPU_IN_SEL2";
	selection-gpios = <&gpiom1 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>, /* IO_A12_IN_SEL0 */
				<&gpiom1 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>, /* IO_A12_IN_SEL1 */
				<&gpiom1 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* IO_A12_IN_SEL2 */
	selection-mapping-names = "STG", "STB", "VTD";
	selection-mappings = <0>, <5>, <3>;
	default-input-mode = "VTD"
};

- Output only:
software_configurable_output {
	compatible = "hed,software-configurable-io";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_softcfgout-a06>;
	output-only;
	output-gpio = <&gpio1 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	default-output-status = <0>;
};

- Output and Input:
software_configurable_io {
	compatible = "hed,software-configurable-io";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_softcfgio>;
	output-and-input;
	output-pwm;
	pwms = <&pwm8 0 1000000>;
	default-output-status = <0>;
	input-gpio = <&gpio5 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	io-channels = <&adc 0>;
	io-channel-names = "input1";
	selection-gpio-names = "SOM_A01_O_SEL";
	selection-gpios = <&gpio5 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* SOM_A01_O_SEL */
	selection-mapping-names = "STG", "STB";
	selection-mappings = <0>, <1>;
	default-input-mode = "STG";
